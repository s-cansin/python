## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python** 2.7+ or 3.x
- **PyQt4** - GUI development framework
- **PyQt4.QtSql** - SQL database module
- **Microsoft Access Driver** (ODBC) - For address book
- **Python Math Library** - For scientific calculations

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
python --version  # Python 2.7+ or 3.x required
```

### Installing Dependencies

**For Windows:**

```bash
# Install PyQt4
pip install PyQt4

# Install ODBC driver for Microsoft Access
# Download and install Microsoft Access Database Engine
# https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920
```

**Note:** PyQt4 is older and may require Python 2.7. For modern systems, consider migrating to PyQt5 or PyQt6.

### Database Setup (For Address Book)

1. Create a Microsoft Access database file named `db.accdb`
2. Create a table named `address` with the following structure:
   - `name` (Text)
   - `surname` (Text)
   - `phone` (Text)
   - `home` (Text)
3. Place the database file in: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\`
   - Or modify the default path in the application

## üíª Usage

### Running the Scientific Calculator

```bash
python calculator.py
```

**Operations:**
- Click number buttons to enter values
- Select angle unit from dropdown (radyan/derece/grad)
- Use operation buttons for calculations
- Click "Temizle" to clear display
- Click "=" to get results

### Running the Compound Interest Calculator

```bash
python compound_interest.py
```

**Input Required:**
1. Enter principal amount (debt amount)
2. Enter monthly interest rate as percentage (e.g., 5.5 for 5.5%)
3. Program calculates optimal monthly payment plan

**Example:**
```
Enter Principal Amount: 10000
Enter Monthly Interest Rate: 2.5
Output: Payment Plan: 876.23 USD x 12 MONTH
```

### Running the Address Book

```bash
python access_db.py
```

**Steps:**
1. Verify database path in the text field
2. Click "Browse File" to select database (if needed)
3. Application displays top 10 records from address table
4. Records show in table format with all fields

**Important:** Ensure the Access database file exists at the specified path before running.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Database Path Configuration
The address book application expects the database at:
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\db.accdb
```

**To change the default path:**
1. Modify the path in the text field before browsing
2. Or edit line 17 in `access_db.py`:
```python
directory.setText(r"YOUR\CUSTOM\PATH\db.accdb")
```

### PyQt4 Compatibility
- These projects use **PyQt4**, which is older and not actively maintained
- PyQt4 is compatible with Python 2.7
- For Python 3.x compatibility, minor modifications may be needed
- Consider upgrading to PyQt5 or PyQt6 for production use

### Calculator Language
- Button labels: "Temizle" (Clear), "Kok" (Root), "Karesi" (Square), "Tersi" (Reciprocal)
